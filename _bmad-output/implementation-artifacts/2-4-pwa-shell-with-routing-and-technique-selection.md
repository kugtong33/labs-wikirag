# Story 2.4: PWA Shell with Routing and Technique Selection

Status: done

## Story
As a user, I want to open WikiRAG in my browser as an installable app with technique selection.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. App loads within 3 seconds on localhost with PWA install option
2. Single query view as default with technique selector dropdown
3. Mode toggle switches between single/comparison within 100ms (client-side)
4. Keyboard navigation reaches all interactive elements
5. Semantic HTML for accessibility

### Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [ ] [AI-Review][Low] Add PNG icon variants (192x192 and 512x512) for broader cross-browser install compatibility in addition to SVG manifest icon [apps/web/vite.config.ts:24]

## Dev Notes

**Implementation:** React SPA in apps/web with Vite + vite-plugin-pwa. Zustand for state, Tailwind CSS v4 for UI, React Router v7 for routing.

**Key Files:** apps/web/src/App.tsx, pages/SingleQuery.tsx, components/TechniqueSelector.tsx, stores/query-store.ts, vite.config.ts (manifest via vite-plugin-pwa)

**Testing:** Vitest + React Testing Library with jsdom environment, 15 tests across 3 test files.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
claude-sonnet-4-6

### Debug Log References
- `import.meta.env` access: Needed `import.meta.env['VITE_API_BASE_URL']` (bracket notation) for TypeScript strict compliance.
- Test isolation for App: Used `MemoryRouter` from `react-router-dom` to test routing without `BrowserRouter` history side-effects.
- Tailwind v4 integration: No `tailwind.config.ts` needed — `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS file + `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin handles everything.

### Completion Notes List
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite 6 + `@vitejs/plugin-react` + `@tailwindcss/vite` + `VitePWA` with `generateSW` strategy; manifest includes name, icons, `display: standalone`.
- `index.html`: Vite HTML entry with `#root`, theme-color, and explicit `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest">` for installability signaling.
- `public/wikirag.svg`: Simple SVG icon (blue square with "W") for PWA manifest.
- `src/index.css`: Single `@import "tailwindcss"` — all Tailwind v4 utilities available without config file.
- `src/stores/query-store.ts`: Zustand store with `mode` (single|comparison), `technique` (default: naive-rag), `query` string, and setters. All state transitions synchronous.
- `src/components/TechniqueSelector.tsx`: Native `<select>` with associated `<label>` (htmlFor/id). Keyboard/screen-reader accessible, passes `onChange` callback.
- `src/pages/SingleQuery.tsx`: `<main>` landmark with `<h1>`, `TechniqueSelector`, mode toggle `<button>` (aria-pressed), query `<textarea>` (labelled). Receives techniques as prop.
- `src/pages/ComparisonMode.tsx`: Added dedicated comparison shell route with semantic structure and keyboard-accessible controls while full dual-stream comparison remains in Story 3.3.
- `src/App.tsx`: Hardens `/api/techniques` payload handling with response-shape guards, syncs route with client-side mode (`/` ↔ `/comparison`) without server round-trips, and logs local warning when DOM content load exceeds 3s budget.
- `src/main.tsx`: Creates React root, wraps app in `<StrictMode>` + `<BrowserRouter>`.
- Vite build: 1.2s, 233KB JS bundle, Tailwind CSS 9KB, service worker generated by Workbox.
- 15 tests: 3 App routing + 5 TechniqueSelector + 7 SingleQuery. All pass.
- Added adversarial review test coverage: `PwaShell.test.ts` validates manifest link presence; `App.test.tsx` now verifies default-vs-comparison route rendering and invalid API payload fallback behavior.
- Historical implementation for this story was validated against commit `06b2b5c` to preserve traceability while reviewing from a clean working tree.

### Senior Developer Review (AI)

- Reviewer: kugtong33
- Date: 2026-02-22
- Outcome: Changes Requested -> Fixed (High/Medium), with low-severity follow-up retained
- Validation summary:
  - AC1 gap addressed with explicit manifest linking and runtime load-budget visibility (`3s` warning instrumentation)
  - AC3 gap addressed by introducing distinct comparison route/view and client-side mode-to-route switching
  - App resilience improved by validating `/api/techniques` response shape before updating UI state
  - Story traceability corrected by documenting historically changed-but-unlisted files from commit `06b2b5c`
- Targeted verification performed:
  - `pnpm --filter @wikirag/web test -- --run` (pass)
  - `pnpm --filter @wikirag/web build` (pass)
